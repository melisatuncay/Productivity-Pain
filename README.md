# 📱 Productivity-Pain
## Abstract
This study, “The Pangs of Productivity”, aims to examine how Generation Z is affected by digital content and technology-oriented productivity pressure. In the study, an online survey was administered to a sample of 50 Gen Z individuals to measure their feelings of productivity, achievement and social media-induced inadequacy. In addition, a comparative analysis was conducted by examining intergenerational self-confidence indicators. 

## 1) Introduction
### 1.1) Problem definition
A problem was identified based on the fact that digital content on social media or dictating discourses on social media use caused Generation Z to struggle with identity issues and not have time to find out what they really want, which was also associated with the “scroll-on” culture of social media.

### 1.2) Definition of today's productivity pressure and why it matters
In today's digital age, productivity is no longer limited to workplace performance or academic output; it has become a social expectation reinforced through digital content, especially on platforms such as Linkedin, TikTok and YouTube. This “culture of constant productivity” tells individuals that they must always be creating, monetizing, learning or evolving to be considered valuable.

**Why does it matter?**

This pressure can lead to burnout, decision fatigue and identity disorganization, especially in young people who are still shaping their goals. It creates a feedback loop: individuals feel they are falling behind, which leads to anxiety, which in turn further diminishes the ability to be productive - ironically achieving the opposite of what the pressure intended.

### 1.3) Why focus on Generation Z
Gen Z **(born between 1997 and 2012)** is the first group to grow up entirely in the digital age. Their formative years were shaped by algorithms, trends, online challenges, hustle culture and digital comparison. From a young age, they consume motivational and achievement-oriented content.

Focusing on Gen Z allows us to examine the psychological and behavioral effects of digital productivity culture on a generation that has never known a world without it. Understanding their experiences can pave the way for action for future generations.

### 1.4) Literature Review
While this field is emerging, a few key references and patterns are observable:

**The Hustle Culture and Its Discontents (2021, Harvard Business Review):** Highlights the glorification of overworking and its mental health costs, especially among young professionals.

**Pew Research Center Reports (2019–2023):** Document Gen Z’s mental health challenges, with digital comparison and pressure among top contributors.

**Digital Self-Harm Among Adolescents (Pew, 2022):** Connects online social pressure to emotional stress in younger users.

**The Influence of Social Media on Academic Motivation and Mental Health in Generation Z (Journal of Adolescent Health, 2020):** Shows a direct link between self-perception, productivity narratives, and feelings of inadequacy.

These studies suggest that algorithmically promoted productivity messaging can erode self-esteem, reinforce unrealistic success models, and increase generalized anxiety in digital-native youth.

## 2) Research Questions
1) How often are you exposed to content like you should be productive on social media (TikTok, Instagram, etc.)?

2) How does this kind of content affect you?

3) Have you ever done something you didn't feel like doing just to feel productive?

4) Do you have thoughts like I should fill my free time, I should do something for myself?

5) Do you think there is an increase in content on social media that encourages people to become entrepreneurs?

6) Do you think social media manipulates what people want?

7) Have you ever felt inadequate after social media?

8) Do you feel like you don't know what you want?

9) Have you ever thought that motivational videos on social media are on the rise?

10) How many hours a day do you use social media on average?
