# 📱 The Pangs of Productivity
## Abstract
This study, “The Pangs of Productivity”, aims to examine how Generation Z is affected by digital content and technology-oriented productivity pressure. In the study, an online survey was administered to a sample of 50 Gen Z individuals to measure their feelings of productivity, achievement and social media-induced inadequacy. In addition, a comparative analysis was conducted by examining intergenerational self-confidence indicators.
